hVision Help

# [hVision][project] tutorial

_hVision is a suite of Haskell packages for computer vision, image processing,
pattern recognition and related applications_



## installation

[installation instructions](git)


## working environment

We need just an editor and a command line terminal, but
I recommend that you configure your editor to compile and run programs directly using shortcut keys. I use gedit with "snippets" and "external tools" configured to do many useful tasks.

It is also convenient to open a navigation tab with the local Haddock documentation page
created by "cabal install" with the option "--enable-documentation".

## hello world!

Show a single image:

CODEFILE(../examples/hello.hs)

Show a live video sequence captured from the default input source (webcam):

CODEFILE(../examples/play.hs)
