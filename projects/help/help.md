# [hVision][project] help system

- - -

Press **F1** in any graphical window to get help.

Your default Internet browser
will open a local web page located in the the current directory, or in a directory
called "help", under or above the current one. We try to open a web page with the same
name as the program executable with extension html. If this page does not exist, we try the
name of the window, or finally a generic "help.html" file like this.

We can write the html help files using markdown, using a simple Makefile and scripts to allow LaTeX (Mathjax) and syntax highlighting (Highlightjs) of code samples.

Help topics:

- [GUI][gui]

- [command line options][options]

- [interactive point capture][points]
