This library provides a simple functional interface to standard matrix computations (eigensystems, singular values, pseudoinverses, etc.) and other numeric algorithms. It is based on high level wrappers for the GNU Scientific Library GSL (<http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl>)
and LAPACK (<http://www.netlib.org/lapack>).

This is a work in progress. The most recent version can be obtained from:
